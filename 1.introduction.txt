What is javascript?
        javascript (often shortened to JS)
        is a lightweight,interpreted,Object-oriented language
        with first-class functions,
        and is best known as the scripting language for web pages,
        but it's used in many non-browser environment as well.

    lightweight --> small memory footprint, easy to implement
    interpreted --> no compilation, Instructions executed directly.
    Object-oriented --> Modeled around objects.
    first-class functions --> Functions as values[func can be assigned to variables].
    scripting language --> instructions written for a run time environment.

Run time environment [A web browser]
    ->webPage -> url ->server[accessing the url] -> webPage for the url travels in https in Html form(bunch of string)
    -> reaches the browser(form the tags as parent obj and child obj) and forms the dom trees -> displayes the dom trees

    Html is a static one displays the same thing for the different refreshes...

    with the help of JS we can change/edit/delete/create/modify the dom tree for the different refreshes of the page.
