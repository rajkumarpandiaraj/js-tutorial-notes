                                        4.variables and Types

variable declaration :
    var value = 42; or var value; value = 20;
    In JS no need to mention the type of the variable lyk int,char, float etc...,

Number Primitive types :
Primitive Types : [comes with language]
    -> Number
    -> String
    -> Boolean
    -> undefined
    -> null
    -> symbol (new onw)
Number :
    Numbers in JavaScript are "double-precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 values"
    no integer
    In js 1 is not an integer. It is also an double

Strings :
    sequences of unicode characters(16-bit)
    no character type. A character is just a string of length 1.

Boolean :
    true/false.

undefined :
    declaration :
        var value //variable declaration
    definition :
        value = 21; //variable definition
        var value = 21 //variable declaration and definition in on line
    
    declared variable automatically holds the value of undefined if we didn't done the variable definition.
Example :
    var value;
    console.log(value)// undefined
    value = 22;
    console.log(value)//22

null :
    var a = null
    condole.log(a)//null

Difference between undefined vs null :
    null :
        it is the value given to the variable purprosally by the user to make variable value as empty.
    undefined :
        it is default empty value given to the variable by JS.

Summary :
    -> no need to declare variable type.
    -> The same variable can be assigned values of different types.
    -> No scoping information in variable declarations.[public,void lyk that]
    -> variables and values can be "interrogated"

typeof Operator :
    var a = 21;
    var b = 'hi';
    var c = true;
    var d = null;
    console.log(typeof a) //number
    console.log(typeof b) // string
    console.log(typeof c) // Boolean
    console.log(typeof d) // object
